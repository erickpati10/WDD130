        I would like to <strong>share</strong> about my experience this last
        year on learning new skills. I like to always <em>learn</em> and that
        has been one of my goals my whole life. <br />Even when I was a kid, I
        always was curious and willing to try to learn more. One of my passions
        is sports and I grew up playing soccer. <br />This was really the only
        sport I loved growing up. This last year I learned how to play
        pickleball. This is now a passion of mine in my downtime. <br />I also
        have been learning how to remodel a house. I have learned to put in
        flooring, plumbing, baseboards, painting, tiling. <br />I am excited to
        keep learning in my life and to continue learning in my education.
